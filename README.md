# To Do List app

HiðŸ‘‹.
This is a [svelte](https://svelte.dev/)+[ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) project I've made of a **To Do List** app.

## Running it

If you're trying to run it localy, first install all dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), and then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
